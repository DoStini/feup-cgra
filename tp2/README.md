### Exercise 1

- We chose the right lower corner of the blue big triangle as the center of the image
- We had to calculate some translation values for the orange triangle. From the original position
  - Rotate -45ยบ
  - Translate sqrt(2) in the y axis. sqrt(2) is half of the side of the triangle
  - Translate 2-sqrt(2) in the x axis. 2 is half the base of the triangle and sqrt(2) is half of the smaller side of the triangle
- In exercise 2 we had difficulties in Y
