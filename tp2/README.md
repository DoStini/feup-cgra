### Exercise 1

- We chose the right lower corner of the blue big triangle as the center of the image
- We had to calculate some translation values for the orange triangle. From the original position
  - Rotate -45ยบ
  - Translate sqrt(2) in the y axis. sqrt(2) is half of the side of the triangle
  - Translate 2-sqrt(2) in the x axis. 2 is half the base of the triangle and sqrt(2) is half of the smaller side of the triangle
- For the pink triangle:
  - Rotate 45ยบ
  - Translate 2+sqrt(2) to the left in the x axis. sqrt(2) is half of the size of the hypotenuse of the pink triangle, 2 is half of the size of the big triangle.
- For the diamond:
  - Math.sqrt(2)+1 - 2 + Math.sqrt(2) was applied
    - Math.sqrt(2)+1 is the translation applied so that the vertex of the head touches the untranslated body triangle
    - -2 + Math.sqrt(2) is the same translation applied to the body triangle.


- In exercise 2 we had difficulties in Y
